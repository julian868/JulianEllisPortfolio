                I created this site to showcase some of my capabilities in software development.
                The site itself is a portfolio entry as I built it using Angular 16 and the PrimeNG Library.<br>

                After completing a double major in Economics and Environmental Science at the University of Toronto in
                late 2019, personal challenges coupled with the
                Covid-19 pandemic returned me to school to pursue a Computer Programming Diploma at Sheridan College.
                This decision birthed a true
                passion for software development, one which I wish I had discovered much earlier. My strong aptitude and
                abilities in math and
                science have truly complemented my skill, interest and desire to grow in the IT field.<br>
                Now that I have graduated my goal is to continue to grow and develop in a professional setting. It is a
                priority
                that I find myself in environments where I can foster this growth by learning from others, making
                positive contributions
                and hopefully to one day inspire others on a similar path.
